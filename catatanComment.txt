CLASS LEVEL
{@link <The Link>} provides an inline link to a referenced part of our source code
@author is the name of the author who added the class, method, or field that’s commented

Example:
/**
* Hero is the main entity we'll be using to . . .
*
* Please see the {@link com.baeldung.javadoc.Person} class for true identity
* @author Captain America
*
*/

FIELD LEVEL
Example:
/**
 * The public name of a hero that is common knowledge
 */
Note: Private fields won’t have Javadoc generated for them unless we explicitly pass the -private option to the Javadoc command.

METHOD LEVEL
@param provides any useful description about a method’s parameter or input it should expect
@return provides a description of what a method will or can return
@see will generate a link similar to the {@link} tag, but more in the context of a reference and not inline
@throws is used to further explain the cases the software would expect an exception

Example:
/**
 * <p>This is a simple description of the method. . .
 * <a href="http://www.supermanisthegreatest.com">Superman!</a>
 * </p>
 * @param incomingDamage the amount of incoming damage
 * @return the amount of health hero has after attack
 * @see <a href="http://www.link_to_jira/HERO-402">HERO-402</a>
 * @since 1.0
 */

 Note: We wouldn't use the "since" tag since it doesn't have any version
